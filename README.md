# Oto_dom_regression
  The project presented here is a practical example of using Machine Learning. It contains all the necessary elements from data acquisition, through data cleaning, analysis and processing, to training of various types of regression models. The aim is to create a model predicting prices on the Warsaw housing market, based on data coming from OtoDom.pl portal.

  In my opinion nowadays data is a new kind of raw material - it is acquired, processed, stored and traded, and all this because it is a fuel for AI technology which is developing faster and faster. A regression or classification model is only as good as the data that trained it. The work on new models always starts with the acquisition of data, therefore the first step in the described project is to create a Data Scrapper, which will allow to take the existing housing offers from the OtoDom.pl classifieds portal. Then the data will be saved to a file in .csv format.
